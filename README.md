MNE-Python introductory slides

Historically: `mne_python_06192012`, an MNE-Python presentation from June 19 2012 at Aalto Univeristy


Getting started
===============

There is a `.nojekyll` file inside this repository which means [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is not going to be used. Instead it's your responsibility to build and commit the `index.html` that will be displayed as requested in `config.cfg`. To do so you'll need to install the [landslide](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/landslide). For convenience we have specified a `Makefile`. Having met the landslide dependency hit `make` and take a look at the resulting `index.html` in your web-browser. Note. You'll need to hit 'make clean' to rebuild if you did not make changes to `index.rst`. Such situations commonly occur when editing or scaling images.
